## Redo of the internship-12-intro-to-js homework

At the time that this homework was written, I was a part of an internship at the DUMP association. This was the 12. homework that we were supposed to make. It was an introduction to the javascript language.

Unfortunately, I have not exceled at this homework, not even close. But, since this is on my github and somebody might go through this, I will change this complete repository.

This homework does not reflect my knowledge and experience with JS that I have today. As such, I will fix it appropriately. Also, I have access to given homeworks from a year prior, as well as the homework from year after me. The repo will be separated into 3 branches, each having a solved homework from that year.

Hopefully, I will also try to have somebody look at the homeworks and give me feedback.
